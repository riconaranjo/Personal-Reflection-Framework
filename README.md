# Personal Reflection Framework

A framework for reviewing and reflecting on my life goals, progress, and hurdles to help me meet my own goals, fulfil my own potential.

The **regularity** of these reviews is **critical**, as this allows for constant adjustment and improvement; no plan ever goes according to plan. It is all to easy to forget about certain goals when you prioritize some goals over others. The objective of this framework is to allow you to plan for — and react to — the reality that not everything goes according to plan, and that you still have a lot to learn.

This framework designed to help you be cognizant of how long it takes to accomplish tasks, and thus improve your planning skills. It will allow you to think about how you can improve, why you are not accomplishing what you think you should be able to, and most importantly it will help you reach your own goals.

The hallmark of successful people is constant and **iterative improvement**. I will be constantly tweaking and reworking this framework to better suit my needs, and hopefully yours as well; I encourage you to change whatever doesn't work for you, and make this **your own** personal reflection framework

# Goals and Tasks
**Goals** are higher level objectives [e.g. write a book]</br>
**Goals** can be broken up into smaller goals [e.g. write chapter 1]</br>
**Tasks** are the actionable components of goals [e.g. write 10 pages this week]</br>

# Weekly

# Yearly

Review to be done either late december or early january. It is also to be done alongside, not replacing a regular monthly review, nor a weekly review, but it does not need to be completed at the same time as either of these.

1. **What were my goals this year?**
    - Create a list, with deadlines if applicable.
    - Did I succeed or fail with each one?
    - What were the reasons for success / failure?
    - How can I increase my probabilities of success?
    - How can I mitigate the reasons for failure?
2. **Prioritize + review ongoing goals.**
    - Should any be modified / added / removed?
    - Do I need to change any deadlines?
    - Do I have the capacity for all these goals?
3. **Am I satisfied with the progress of my goals this year?**
    - What should I keep doing / change this year?
4. **Are there any challenges coming up this year?**
    - How can I prepare for this?
    - How can I overcome these?
5. **What changes do I want to see in my life?**
    - How can I make these changes a part of my life?
    - What should my theme / focus be for the year?
