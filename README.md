# Goals

**This framework is designed to ensure:**

1. _**No tasks** are forgotten or deadlines missed_
2. _**Continual improvements** made through retrospection_

# Reflections

There are **four types** of reflections. Consistently performing these reviews is crucial, both in order to make **new habits.** Performing consistent reflections also makes the other higher-level reflections **shorter and more effective**.

1. Daily
2. Weekly
3. Monthly
4. Yearly

# Daily

These should be short — about 2-10 min — and should cover both what you did that day, and what you want to get done tomorrow.

1. **Review today’s tasks**
	- _Which tasks did you **complete**?_
	- _Which ones did you **not complete**?_
2. **Write a few points**
	- _What **did you do** today?_
	- _What **went well**? Why?_
	- _What **didn’t go so well**? Why?_
	- _What could you **do better** next time?_
3. **Create a list**
	- _Which tasks you want to get **done tomorrow**?_
	- _Should any of today’s **uncompleted tasks** be carried forward?_
	- _Which tasks do you **have to work on** tomorrow?_
	- _Which tasks would you **like to work on** tomorrow?_


# Weekly

These are a bit longer, about — about 5-30 min — and cover the main goals you wanted to get done that week, and what you want to get done in the next week.

You should give each task a day you plan to finish it by, that way you can plan out what your workload will be during the week.

1. **Review your weekly tasks**
	- _Which tasks did you **complete**?_
	- _Which ones did you **not complete**?_
2. **Write a few points**
	- What were the **highlights** of the week?
	- _What **went well**? Why?_
	- _What **didn’t go so well**? Why?_
	- _How could you **improve** things going forward?_
3. **Create a list of tasks you want to get done this week**
	- _Rank them by **priority**_
	- _Give each task a **soft deadline**, a date on which you will complete it — a few days before any hard deadlines_
