# Personal Reflection Framework
#personal
A framework for reviewing and reflecting on my life goals, progress, and hurdles to help ensure that I am able to meet my own goals, and am able to fulfil my own potential.

The regularity of these reviews is critical, as this is what allows for constant adjustment, as no plan ever goes according to plan. It is all to easy to forget about certain goals when you prioritize some goals over others. The objective of this framework is to allow you to react to the reality that not everything goes according to plan, and that you still have a lot to learn.

It is designed to help you be cognizant of how long it takes to accomplish tasks, and thus improve your planning skills. It will allow you to think about how you can improve, why you are not accomplishing what you think you should be able to, and most importantly it will help you live a truly fulfilling life.

# Goals and Tasks
**Goals** are higher level objectives [e.g. write a book]</br>
**Goals** can be broken up into smaller goals [e.g. write chapter 1]</br>
**Tasks** are the actionable components of goals [e.g. write 10 pages this week]</br>
